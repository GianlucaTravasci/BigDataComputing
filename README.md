# BigDataComputing
Homeworks for the Big Data Computing's course

## Homework 1
The homework consists of a program which runs in Java and the Spark framework to implement the Class Count MapReduce algorithm in different versions: with deterministic partitions and with Spark partitions. The homework was designed to be developed and run on a personal computer.

The homework is solved in class G09HW1.

## Homework 2
The homework consists of a program which runs in Java and uses the Spark framework just for some utilies (such as class Vector) to implement the Maximum Pairwise Distance algorithm in different versions: exact solution (quadratic on the input size), 2-approximation by taking k random points from the pointset, exact solution by taking k points returned by the Farthest-First Traversal algorithm (algorithm which solves the k-center clustering problem). The homework was designed to be developed and run on a personal computer.

he homework is solved in class G09HW2.

## Homework 3
The homework consists of a program which runs in Java and the Spark framework to implement the coreset-based Diversity Maximization algorithm. The program runs a 2 round MapReduce algorithm which first computes the coreset and then runs the exact algorithm on the coreset. The homework was designed to be developed and run on a personal computer for small datasets and on a cluster for large datasets.

The homework is solved in class G09HW3.
